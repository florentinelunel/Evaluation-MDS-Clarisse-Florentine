<h1>Our My Digital School Project</h1>

<h2>About us</h2>

We are Clarisse and Florentine, we are 20 and 18 years old and we are both passionate about digital.
We have a dream in common, that of becoming Ux/Ui designer. So we study at My digital school in order to achieve this.

<h2>How we work</h2>

<p>Our project was to create a website to present our school, its features and its teachers in a single page. 
We used HTML & Css to carry out this project.</p>
<br>
<p>We also used Github to update our work and facilitate collaborative work.</p>

<h2>What you are introduced to</h2>

We present you our site, made especially for our school. 
We wanted to make sure that all the necessary information was on one page. We also added a contact form to keep a link with our future users.
